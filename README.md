# Speed-of-a-vehicle
In this project i have used background substractor to detect vehicles on the road.
For calculating the speed of the vehicle :-
      the total number of frames the car was present in the scene by the current framerate, you'll get the number of seconds the car was present in the scene.

Time [seconds] = Total [Frames] / [Frames / Second] .
For this i have made two arbitary lines and the total number of frames in which the car was present in between the two lines is calculated 
and the speed is calculated by converting it into km/h.
